## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
    
    Spotify
    - creates playlist based off users activity
    - Suggest new albums or songs of users favorite artist

    
    TikTok
    - ability to display history of liked videos
    - seperate section for live streams
    

    Instagram 
    - Close friends selection
    - adding music to stories 
    - sharing a thought feature 
    
    App Idea:
    Gym app that allows users to add each other and update their status on when they are going to the gym, what muscle group they wish to work, and the duration of the workout. Users will be able to not only track their workout time, but also track their goals whether it be a certain number of reps done or a certain amount of weight lifted for a particular exercise. Users should also have the opportunity to message or ping a friend if they plan on working out together.
    
## Notes
Working on familiarizing myself with Xcode and using swift as the programming language.
